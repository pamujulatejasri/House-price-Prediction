# House-price-Prediction
House Price Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to estimate residential property prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other relevant attributes. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine house prices using historical housing.

📊 Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing trends, correlations, and patterns in housing data.

🤖 Model Building – Implementation of regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and other machine learning models.

📉 Model Evaluation – Performance evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score.

🚀 Deployment Ready (Optional) – API or web app integration for real-time predictions.

🔧 Technologies Used

Python

NumPy & Pandas

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Flask / FastAPI for deployment

🎯 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the complete machine learning workflow — from data cleaning and visualization to model training, evaluation, and deployment — in a real-world regression problem.
